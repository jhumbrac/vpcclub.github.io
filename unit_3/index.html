			 	<h1>Our Mission</h1>

	<p>The Victoria Police Cricket Club was formed in 1977 and is affiliated with the Victoria Police Amateur Sports and Welfare Society.</p>

	<p>The Club was initially established to compete in the 1977 Australian Police Cricket Carnival, which is now known as the Australia and New Zealand Police Cricket Championships. Today, a major function of the Club is to participate in a Community Engagement events designed to enhance the relationship between Victoria Police and the wider community of Victoria.</p>

	
	<p>The objectives of these events is to encourage camaraderie, physical fitness and goodwill amongst members of the Victoria Police and project a favourable image of Victoria Police into the wider community by using cricket as a vehicle to engage with a cross-section of Victorians with a particular focus on culturally, linguistically and religiously diverse communities. Additionally, to promote and encourage sportsmanship, a sense of fair play and the game of cricket itself.</p>

	<P>Victoria Police Cricket Club was named the Most Outstanding Sports Club at Victoria Police Amateur Sports and Welfare Society Awards in 2015 and received the Police Media Multicultural Award at Victoria's Multicultural Awards for Excellence in 2016.</P>

			<h2>The George Howell Shield</h2>
			<h3>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Assumption College, Kilmore</h3>

	<p>Constable George Howell (10323) was stationed at Malvern East and on 30th January 1952 after swapping shifts he was to work from 5p.m. until 1:30a.m.  George had been assigned the task of patrolling the area surrounding the Crystal Palace Theatre in Dandenong Road, to combat escalating car theft. The heroic Officer attempted to follow his attacker before collapsing onto the roadway.  While George lay fighting for his life and thought of his loved ones he still managed to provide vital information to members at the scene.  At the hospital he provided a dying deposition and told Investigators everything he could about his assailant.  With his fiancé bedside, George went into Surgery.</p>

	<p>Unfortunately the following morning George died. He was only 25 years old.</p>

	<p>George’s funeral was one of the largest ever seen in Melbourne at that time with 3000 attendees.  Upon capture, George’s assailant was convicted of murder and his death sentence subsequently commuted to life imprisonment.George Howell was posthumously awarded the Kings Police Medal for ‘conspicuous gallantry in attempting the arrest of an armed criminal’.</p>

	<p>It is not known if George had any cricketing aspirations but later this same year the Russell Street Cricket Club struck the inaugural George Howell Shield during a match against Kilmore College in his honour. 50 years later it is not known whatever happened to the George Howell Shield or exactly how many matches were played after 1952.  What is now known is to be continued as a legacy to honour a colleague who missed the opportunities in life that we all take for granted.</p>

	<p>In recognition The Victoria Police Cricket Club has re-established the George Howell Shield as an annual fixture to be played against Assumption College Kilmore.</p>

			<h2>Kerrup-Inon-Marr Sheild</h2>
			<h3>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Cricket Victoria Imparja Cup Squad</h3>

	<p>The “kerrup-inon-marr” (meaning kinship and side-by-side) Shield is a community engagement event that commenced in February 2013 between the VPCC and the 
	Victorian Imparja Cup Squad, which forms part of the Cricket Victoria Noogal Toengorrt Tani Cricket Program. This program is designed to provide
	participation and development opportunities for Indigenous Australians to participate in cricket. The Imparja Cup Squad is a team of highly talented Indigenous cricketers from across Victoria.</p>

	<p>The game is a way for the club, as representatives of Victoria Police, to enhance the sometimes strained relationship between police and Indigenous
	Australians. It also serves as match practice for the Imparja boys as they prepare for the Imparja Cup, an annual cricket tournament for Indigenous Australians
	held in the Northern Territory.</p> 

	<p>In 2017, the Victorians took out the National title, be beating New South Wales by 18 runs.</p>



					<h2>Harmony in Cricket Cup</h2>
					<h3>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Western Warriors Cricket Club</h3>


	<p>In 2015, a young male of Muslim faith was fatally shot outside the Endeavour Hills Police Station after he attacked two police officers with a knife. In the following days public sentiment focused on the negative aspect of the 
	Islamic faith and at times labelled all Muslims as extremists. In light of the tension within the community, the Victoria Police Cricket Club, in conjunction
	with Cricket Victoria’s Harmony in Cricket Program, developed an annual T20 cricket match, called the Harmony in Cricket Cup, which is aimed at improving the
	relationship between the police and the Islamic community of Melbourne through cricket, while also showing that regardless of religious beliefs, two groups can
	come together in the name of cricket. This annual match is played against the Western Warriors Cricket Club, a team of ex-pat Pakistaniand Indian Muslim 
	cricketers.</p>


      			<h2>The Luke Batty Memorial Shield</h2>
				<h3>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Tyabb Cricket Club</h3>

	<p>In February 2016 the Victoria Police Cricket Club headed to Bunguyan Reserve in Tyabb, for the inaugural Luke Batty Memorial Shield, a T20
	cricket match against the Tyabb Cricket Club. The event was instigated by the VPCC to raise awareness of the issue of domestic violence in the community and also to honour the memory of Luke Batty who was killed by his father just over two years earlier whilst he trained in the nets with his
	friends and Tyabb CC team mates.</p>

	<p>The match gave the local community another chance to come together to
	remember Luke but also to celebrate the game of cricket. The VPCC are acutely aware of the issue of Family Violence and the impact it has on the local community and saw this event as a positive way to continue to raise awareness and encourage victims to take a stand and seek support. The match also allowed Police to interact with members of the Tyabb community in a positive environment.</p>

	<p>The match was attended by Luke’s mother and former Australian of the
	Year, Rosie Batty as well as senior Victoria Police staff. The match also
	attracted the support of Cricket Victoria, with a representative from the
	Melbourne Stars Women’s Big Bash League team on hand to present a cheque to
	the Luke Batty Foundation.</p>

					
					<h2>Harmony In Cricket Asylum Seeker Cup</h2>
			<h3>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Monash Health Service Asylum Seekers</h3>

	<p>In 2017 the VPCC, in partnership with the Monash Health, Refugee Health and
	Wellbeing Program developed a community engagement event aimed at bringing
	police and refugees together through cricket to break down barriers and
	strengthen relationships between members of Victoria Police and Refugees and
	Asylum Seekers.</p>



				<h2>Emergency Services Mental Health Awareness Cup suporting beyondblue</h2>
				<h3>Victoria Police Cricket Club v Metropolican Fire Brigade Cricket Club</h3>

	<p>In recent years, the club has come together with the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Cricket Club (MFBCC) in an effort to raise awareness of depression and
	suicide amongst Emergency Service Personnel. The match also helped to raise valuable funds for beyondblue which is undertaking consideralbe work to develop a package of resources to assist emergency service workers to both prevent and better deal with mental health issues. With the help of The Police Association and beyondblue, both the VPCC and the MFBCC hope to grow this 
	event well into the future and ensure this important issue is addressed</p>




				<h2>VPCC “Police In Schools” Program</h2>

	<p>Each year the club participates in a number of one-day matches (40 or 45 over per side) against various secondary schools and colleges around Victoria. This is designed to strengthen relationships with the younger members of the community by interacting with them in a positive environment. There are annual matches against Mentone Grammar and Assumption College Kilmore. The Club is pursuing partnership opportunities for these school events with not for profit organsiations to create and educational and support elements to these games relevant to school age students such as anti-bullying and cyber safety</p>



			<H2>Other Community Engagement Activities</H2>

	<p>In the past the Victoria Police Cricket Club has also competed in cricket matches against the Brimbank Community XI and the Indigos Cricket Team, both of which are designed improve the relationship between Victoria Police and the community within Victoria and allows us to interact with Culturally and Linguistically Diverse communities in a positive environment. The Victoria Police Cricket Club looks forward to continuing these events into the future.</p>

		<h1>History</h1>

	
	<h2>Australia and New Zealand Police Cricket Championships</h2>

	<p>One of the Club’s primary functions is to compete in the biennial Australia and New Zealand Police Cricket Championships.</p>

	<p>In 1977 Canberra held the inaugural Australasian Police Cricket Carnival in commemoration of their 50th year anniversary.  Five teams took part at this event: ACT, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria.  New South Wales eventually won this first Championship with Victoria being runners-up.It was decided among the clubs to continue this incredibly successful Championship on a bi-ennial basis with each club alternating as host.</p>  

	<p>There are currently six core teams competing for the title with New Zealand and Western Australia having since joined the competition.</p>

	<p>Since 1977 a total of 15 Carnivals have been held across Australasia:</p>

		<ul>
		<li>1977 – Canberra</li>
		<li>1979 – Gold Coast*</li>
		<li>1981 – Adelaide</li>
		<li>1983 – Sydney</li>
		<li>1984 – Melbourne*</li>
		<li>1986 – Darwin*</li>
		<li>1988 – Sydney</li>
		<li>1990 – Sunshine Coast*</li>
		<li>1995 – Christchurch</li>
		<li>1997 – Melbourne*</li>
		<li>1999 – Brisbane*</li>
		<li>2002 – Adelaide</li>
		<li>2004 – Sydney</li>
		<li>2006 – Christchurch</li>
		<li>2009 – Perth</li>
		<li>2011 – Melbourne*</li>
		<li>2012 – Gold Coast</li>
		<li>2015 – Auckland</li>
		<li>2016 - Adelaide</li>
		</ul>


	<p>Victoria has won* a total of seven Championships and built both strong rapport as well as a fierce rivalry with many teams.</p>


	<p>The standard of cricket provides for a wide scale of skills and abilities.  Teams have comprised of previous and current national Test players, first class players, first grade players and local club cricketers.  This competition is a great leveller for all standards of play and can certainly bring the best out of everyone.  It is not incumbent that players be outstanding grade cricketers, more importantly is simply the desire to participate.  Most state’s team comprises cricketers from all these aforementioned levels with some notable differences each Carnival.</p>

	<p>Outside of the playing arena, the social interaction is definitely first class.  Cricket can be both intense or played in a relaxed state with team interaction assured at post match celebrations.  Interstate networking is very much encouraged and many a life long friend can be made.  Social functions, team dinners and a presentation evening are all on the week’s agenda.</p>

	<p>Carnivals will generally fixture games Sunday to Friday with a mid-week rest day for that well earned break or sight seeing.  This enables players to travel interstate while maintaining their own club cricket commitments.  Travel arrangements are reflected by members desire not to miss their own club matches on Saturday.  The current number of teams ensures a round-robin tournament with the winner finishing highest on the table.  Finals are no longer played.</p>


	<p>Individual awards are bestowed upon outstanding performances in addition to the Championship Shield for the winning club.  At the conclusion of each Carnival, the A.P.C.C. Executive selects an Australasian Representative side, reflective of individual achievements during the week.</p> 

	<p>The following Victorian members have been recognised in the Australasian Merit Team at the following carnivals:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>1998 - J. O’Connor, W. Ladgrove, A. Fincher, D. Jakobi</li>
