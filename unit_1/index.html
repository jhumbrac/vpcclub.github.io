	<h1>Victoria Police Cricket Club</h1>

	<p>The Victoria Police Cricket Club (VPCC) was formed in 1977 and became incorporated in 1981. The Club is affiliated with the Victoria Police Amateur Sports and Welfare Society, who play a major role in ensuring the financial success of the Club.

<p>The Club was primarily established to compete in the Australian Police Cricket Carnival, which is now known as the Australia and New Zealand Police Cricket Championships.</p>

<p>These days, a major function of the club is to participate in a number of Community Engagement events aimed at improving the relationship between Victoria Police and the wider community of Victoria through cricket.</p>
